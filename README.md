# 🌐 GRAPH VISUALIZER

An interactive web-based tool to visualize and understand **graph data structures** and **graph algorithms** such as BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra’s Shortest Path.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
**GRAPH VISUALIZER** lets users learn graph theory concepts through intuitive, real-time visualization.  
You can dynamically create, connect, and manipulate nodes and edges directly on the screen, and observe algorithms unfold step-by-step.

**Live Demo:** https://graph-algorithms-visualizer.vercel.app

## 🚀 Features
- Add and remove nodes or edges interactively  
- Visualize **BFS**, **DFS**, and **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**  
- Support for **directed** and **undirected** graphs  
- Animated traversal highlighting  
- Drag-and-drop interface for nodes  
- Real-time pathfinding display
